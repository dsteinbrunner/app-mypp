* Example
* Future plans..?

--- What is it
App::Mypp is a zeroconf alternative to Dist::Zilla. Mypp does not have the
same features as distzilla, but I like to think of mypp vs dzil as
cpanm vs CPAN - or at least that is what I'm aiming for.
So this means that it is a tool which can auto-generate and maintain
files for your distribution (such as t/foo, Changes, README), and also
help you share a new release.

NOTE: er dette etter dist-zilla talk'n?

--- Why did I write it?
I wrote mypp because I was pretty tired from forgetting the most basic
tasks when releasing a module to cpan. Things like updating Changes and
version numbers is probably what I forget the most often.

--- What can it do?
* timestamp_to_changes()
 * Will add a timestamp after the latest version number in Changes
* update_version_info()
 * Will update main module with the latest version from Changes
* generate_readme()
 * Will create README from main module
* manifest()
 * Will create MAINIFEST and MANIFEST.SKIP with and alternative list
* makefile()
 * Based on Module::Install
 * Autogenerate requires() list
 * Add "catalyst;" when inside a catalyst project.
 * Add meta info
* t_foo()
 * Creates 00-load.t, 00-pod.t, 00-pod-coverage.t
* tag_and_commit()
 * Creates a new tag+commit with the commit message from Changes
* share_via_git() and share_via_extension()
 * Uploads the new tag+commit to github and shares the tar.gz using
   either CPAN::Upload or a custom module.
* clean()
 * "make clean" and more

And it can be run from the Internet:
* wget -q http://github.com/jhthorsen/app-mypp/raw/master/script/mypp-packed -O - | perl -
* wget -q http://bit.ly/???? -O - | perl -

Running the line above will start the experimental code from
github - meaning the latest release. Run at own risk - and don't
forget to put your files under version control first!

-- Example

    mkdir some-project
    cd some-project;
    mkdir -p lib/Some/
    vim lib/Some/Project.pm
    mypp update

--- Future plans
* Add support for .mypp/custom-plugin..?
* Add auto-generation of modules...?
* Change name..?
* Add more auto-generated tests. (Link tests, and more?)
* Keep it simple. Keep it "clean"

I'm actually quite pleased with mypp now, so development is slow these
days. Luckily someone poked me irc://irc.perl.org/#batman, so there
might be some things happening again soon.
